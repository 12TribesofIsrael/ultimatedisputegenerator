## METRO 2 COMPLIANCE DEMAND

All furnishers MUST comply with Metro 2 Format requirements. Any account that fails to meet Metro 2 standards MUST BE DELETED immediately.

**Specific Metro 2 Violations:**
- Inaccurate account status codes
- Incorrect balance reporting
- Invalid date information
- Non-compliant payment history codes

## REINSERTION PROTECTION
Any account that you delete **MUST NOT** be reinserted unless the furnisher certifies that the information is complete and accurate. If reinsertion occurs you are required, under **15 U.S.C §1681i(a)(5)**, to notify me **in writing within 5 days** and to provide all documentation supporting such reinsertion. Failure to do so constitutes an additional FCRA violation and will trigger immediate legal action.

## CONCLUSION AND DEMAND

This is a formal legal demand for the IMMEDIATE DELETION of all disputed accounts. These accounts contain inaccurate, unverifiable, or non-compliant information that violates federal law.

**I DEMAND COMPLETE DELETION, NOT INVESTIGATION. INVESTIGATION IS INSUFFICIENT.**

Failure to delete these accounts within 30 days will result in legal action to enforce my rights under federal law.

## CERTIFICATION

I certify under penalty of perjury that the information in this dispute is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
