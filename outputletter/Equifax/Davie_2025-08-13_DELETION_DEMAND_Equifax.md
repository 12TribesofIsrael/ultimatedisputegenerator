## SPECIFIC DEMANDS FOR ACTION

I hereby DEMAND that Equifax:

### 1. IMMEDIATE DELETION REQUIRED
- **DELETE** all above-listed accounts in their entirety
- **REMOVE** all associated negative payment history
- **ELIMINATE** all derogatory marks and comments
- **EXPUNGE** all collection references and charge-off notations

### 2. LEGAL COMPLIANCE REQUIRED  
- **VERIFY** all account numbers and creditor information

### 3. REINVESTIGATION STANDARDS
- **CONTACT** each furnisher within 5 business days
- **REQUEST** complete account documentation
- **VERIFY** Metro 2 format compliance
- **DELETE** any unverifiable information immediately


### 15-DAY ACCELERATION – NO FORM LETTERS
I legally and lawfully **REFUSE** any generic form letter response. You now have **15 days**, not 30, to comply with all demands above.

## STATUTORY VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED

The following violations of federal law have been identified:

### FCRA Violations (15 USC §1681)
1. **§1681s-2(a)** - Furnishing inaccurate information
2. **§1681s-2(b)** - Failure to investigate disputed information  
3. **§1681i** - Inadequate reinvestigation procedures
4. **§1681e(b)** - Failure to follow reasonable procedures

### FDCPA Violations (15 USC §1692)
1. **§1692** - Unfair debt collection practices
2. **§1692e** - False or misleading representations
3. **§1692f** - Unfair practices in collecting debts

## STATUTORY DAMAGES CALCULATION

Based on identified violations, potential damages include:

- **FCRA Statutory Damages:** $100-$1,000 per violation × 12 accounts = $12,000
- **FDCPA Statutory Damages:** $1,000 per violation × collection accounts
- **Federal Compliance Violations:** Student loans and regulatory violations
- **Actual Damages:** Credit score harm, loan denials, higher interest rates
- **Punitive Damages:** For willful non-compliance (Round 1 multiplier: 1.0x)
- **Attorney Fees:** Recoverable under both FCRA and FDCPA

**TOTAL POTENTIAL DAMAGES: $22,800 - $40,600**

## DEMAND FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE

### Within 30 Days, Equifax MUST:

1. **DELETE** all disputed accounts listed above
2. **PROVIDE** written confirmation of all deletions
3. **SEND** updated credit report showing deletions
4. **NOTIFY** all parties who received reports in past 2 years
5. **CONFIRM** removal from all Equifax products and services

### Failure to Comply Will Result In:

1. **CFPB Complaint** filing
2. **State Attorney General** complaint  
3. **Federal Court Action** for FCRA violations
4. **Demand for Statutory Damages** up to $24,000
5. **Attorney Fee Recovery** under 15 USC §1681n

## METRO 2 COMPLIANCE DEMAND

All furnishers MUST comply with Metro 2 Format requirements. Any account that fails to meet Metro 2 standards MUST BE DELETED immediately.

**Specific Metro 2 Violations:**
- Inaccurate account status codes
- Incorrect balance reporting
- Invalid date information
- Non-compliant payment history codes

## REINSERTION PROTECTION
Any account that you delete **MUST NOT** be reinserted unless the furnisher certifies that the information is complete and accurate. If reinsertion occurs you are required, under **15 U.S.C §1681i(a)(5)**, to notify me **in writing within 5 days** and to provide all documentation supporting such reinsertion. Failure to do so constitutes an additional FCRA violation and will trigger immediate legal action.

## CONCLUSION AND DEMAND

This is a formal legal demand for the IMMEDIATE DELETION of all disputed accounts. These accounts contain inaccurate, unverifiable, or non-compliant information that violates federal law.

**I DEMAND COMPLETE DELETION, NOT INVESTIGATION. INVESTIGATION IS INSUFFICIENT.**

Failure to delete these accounts within 30 days will result in legal action to enforce my rights under federal law.

## CERTIFICATION

I certify under penalty of perjury that the information in this dispute is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Sincerely,

Atiya Davie
