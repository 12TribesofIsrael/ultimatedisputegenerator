# 🎯 LOVABLE PROMPT - Build Ultimate Dispute Letter Generator Frontend

**Project:** AI-Powered Credit Repair System Frontend  
**Goal:** Create MVP web application for generating professional dispute letters

---

## 📋 **WHAT TO BUILD**

I need you to build a **professional web application** that transforms a command-line credit repair system into a user-friendly interface. This is for a **credit repair business** that helps people dispute negative items on their credit reports.

### **The System (Already Built - Backend Ready):**
- Python-based AI system that analyzes credit reports
- **Round-based escalation system** (R1→R2→R3→R4→R5 Arbitration/Pre‑Suit)
- **Auto-extracted consumer info** (name, address, phone, email from report)
- **Account number capture** (masked/last‑4/full; always included in letters)
- **Account-specific legal targeting** with dynamic citations
- **Dynamic damage calculations** ($7,400-$14,300+ per case)
- **Late-payment policy**: <3 late marks → correction; ≥3 → deletion
- **Metro 2/CDIA enforcement**: field matrix checks and violations callouts
- Generates professional dispute letters with legal citations  
- Creates mailable PDFs ready for credit bureaus
- Uses 19,737-chunk knowledgebase of credit repair expertise
- **Maximum deletion focus** with proven strategies

### Backend v2.2 updates relevant to the frontend
- Creditor name normalization/aliasing (e.g., JPMCB CARD SERVICES → JPMCB CARD, DISCOVERC → DISCOVER, MACYS/CBNA → CBNA, I.C. SYSTEM → IC SYSTEM). Frontend should display the canonical name with an info tooltip showing the raw name from the report.
- Duplicate tradeline consolidation (merge key: canonical creditor + last4 + balance). Frontend should show a “merged duplicates” count and optionally a disclosure of which raw entries were combined.
- Collections-section enforcement and broader context scanning improve accuracy (status is forced to “Collection” inside Collection sections). Frontend should reflect final status, not intermediate cues.
- Filename-safe creditor labels for furnisher letters (prevents duplicate files). Frontend download names will use canonical creditor labels.
- Non‑interactive operations: new `noninteractive_generate_all.py` script and `CLEAN_CHOICE` env var to auto‑apply Smart Clean (2) without prompts. Frontend should expose a “Smart Clean before analyze” toggle (default ON).

### **What Users Need to Do:**
1. **Upload** their credit report PDF (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion)
2. **Generate** AI-powered dispute letter with **account-specific targeting**
3. **Review** dynamic damage calculations and round strategy
4. **Edit** the letter content if needed
5. **Download** professional PDF to mail to credit bureaus
6. **Track rounds** across R1–R5 with next‑due reminders (future feature)
