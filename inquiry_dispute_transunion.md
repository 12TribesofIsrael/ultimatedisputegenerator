Subject: Dispute of Unauthorized Hard Inquiries (FCRA ยง1681b)

Dear TransUnion,

I am writing to dispute the following hard inquiries on my credit report as unauthorized under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) ยง1681b.

Unauthorized inquiries in dispute:

- The disputed inquiries were not authorized by me and do not meet the permissible purpose requirements.

Requested actions:

2. Provide written confirmation of removal and investigation results.
3. Prevent future unauthorized inquiries.

Certification:
- I did not authorize any of the disputed inquiries.

- The information provided is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

Sincerely,
